# WIN-TEASER++
The original repository code running platform is linuxï¼Œthis repository is the unofficial windows version of teaser++,only the C++ version was tested.
## Compared to the previous repository, added some header files under windows in win directory:
+ win
  + dirent.h
  + getopt.c
  + getopt.h
  + unistd.h
  + win_time.h

## Environment
+ PCL1.10
+ CMAKE 3.2.0
+ Eigen 3.4
+ Visual stdio 2019

## 1.Installation
I use cmake-gui to generate the project,but there was an error during the first configure, so I downloaded this part of the code ahead of time and put it in the build directory.

<font color="red">
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:98 (add subdirectory):add subdirectory given source "D:/workspace/TEASER-plusplus-master/build1/pmc-src " which is not an existing directory.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:107(add subdirectory):add subdirectory given source "D:/workspace/TEASER-plusplus-master/build1/tinyply-src" which is not an existing directory.

## 2.Generate dll
Install directory:
+ Install directory/teaserpp:
  + bin
  + include
  + lib


## 3.Test
In order to facilitate the reading of data, I modified the code and used PCL to read the point cloud

code path:
./example/teaser_cpp_fpfh/teaser_cpp_fpfh.cc
